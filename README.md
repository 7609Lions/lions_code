# 7609 Lions Code Repository

The code repository for the FTC team 7609 Lions at the San Diego Jewish Academy. Regulated by the Head of Code and the coding unit. Updated to match each new annual competition, with codes on autonomous and tele-op. Our most recent update has been our use of sensor input for the first time in the 2019-20 FTC competition, where we implemented the image-recognition software Vuforia to conquer autonomous goals.

The 7609 Lions are a committed group of high school students who compete in Qualcomn's annual First Tech Challenge, as well as promote STEM in the San Diego Jewish Academy. We are large supporters of the STEM community within our classes, at our school, and with the larger FTC community of San Diego through our meet hosting.

Right now, we're attempting to continue engineering virtually.
